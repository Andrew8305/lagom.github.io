    <h3>Report bugs</h3>

    <p>
        Even if you're not ready to fix issues yourself just yet, you can help out by verifying issues that have been reported by others.
        Look for issues tagged with the <a href="//github.com/lagom/lagom/issues?labels=needs-verification">needs-verification</a> label.
        You can assist by looking at these issues and doing some checking to confirm whether they're bugs or not.
        You could provide reproducible tests or a sample project, or even just ask the original reporter for more information.
    </p>
