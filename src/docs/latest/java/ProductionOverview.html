<p>Lagom doesn&rsquo;t prescribe any particular production environment, however out of the box support is provided for <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/products/conductr">Lightbend ConductR</a>.</p><h2 id="Deploying-Lagom-services-to-ConductR"><a class="section-marker" href="#Deploying-Lagom-services-to-ConductR">§</a>Deploying Lagom services to ConductR</h2>
<p>Lightbend ConductR is a perfect match for Lagom, as it provides the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a means to manage configuration distinctly from your packaged artifact;</li>
  <li>consolidated logging across many nodes;</li>
  <li>a supervisory system whereby if your service(s) terminate unexpectedly then they are automatically restarted;</li>
  <li>the ability to scale up and down with ease and with speed;</li>
  <li>handling of network failures, in particular those that can lead to a split brain scenario;</li>
  <li>automated seed node discovery when requiring more than one instance of your service so that they may share a cluster;</li>
  <li>the ability to perform rolling updates of your services;</li>
  <li>support for your services being monitored across a cluster; and</li>
  <li>the ability to test your services locally prior to them being deployed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To deploy your Lagom services using ConductR, see <a href="ConductR.html">ConductR</a>.</p><h2 id="Deploying-to-other-platforms"><a class="section-marker" href="#Deploying-to-other-platforms">§</a>Deploying to other platforms</h2>
<p>Lagom sbt support leverages the <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/">sbt-native-packager</a> to produce archives of various types. By default zip archives can be produced, but you can also produce tar.gz, MSI, debian, RPM, Docker and more.</p>
<p>If using Maven, there are many plugins for Maven to produce artifacts for various platforms.</p>
<p>Running a package requires the provision of a service locator implementation i.e. something that provides the ability for your service to be able to lookup the location of another dynamically at runtime. At a technical level, you provide an implementation of a <a href="api/index.html?com/lightbend/lagom/javadsl/api/ServiceLocator.html">ServiceLocator</a>.</p><h3 id="Deploying-using-static-service-locations"><a class="section-marker" href="#Deploying-using-static-service-locations">§</a>Deploying using static service locations</h3>
<p>While we would never advise using static service locations in any production situation, as a means to demonstrating a working Lagom system in the absence of a managed runtime, you may decide to deploy Lagom systems to static locations with a static configuration saying where the systems live.</p>
<p>To aid in achieving this, a <a href="api/index.html?com/lightbend/lagom/javadsl/client/ConfigurationServiceLocator.html"><code>ConfigurationServiceLocator</code></a> is provided that reads the service locator configuration out of Lagom&rsquo;s <code>application.conf</code> file. Here is an example of the configuration for it:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>lagom.services {
  serviceA = &quot;http://10.1.2.3:8080&quot;
  serviceB = &quot;http://10.1.2.4:8080&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To instruct Lagom to use the <code>ConfigurationServiceLocator</code>, you need to bind it to the <a href="api/index.html?com/lightbend/lagom/javadsl/api/ServiceLocator.html"><code>ServiceLocator</code></a> class in your Guice module. Since Lagom already provides a service locator in dev mode, you will likely only want to bind this when Lagom is in production mode. Play supports passing its <code>Environment</code> and <code>Configuration</code> objects to module constructors, so you&rsquo;ll need to add those to your module:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-java">import com.google.inject.AbstractModule;
import com.lightbend.lagom.javadsl.api.ServiceLocator;
import com.lightbend.lagom.javadsl.client.ConfigurationServiceLocator;
import play.Environment;
import com.typesafe.config.Config;

public class ConfigurationServiceLocatorModule extends AbstractModule {

    private final Environment environment;
    private final Config config;

    public ConfigurationServiceLocatorModule(Environment environment, Config config) {
        this.environment = environment;
        this.config = config;
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        if (environment.isProd()) {
            bind(ServiceLocator.class).to(ConfigurationServiceLocator.class);
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to configure a separate module, this configuration can be added to your existing Guice module.</p><h3 id="Deploying-using-static-Cassandra-contact-points"><a class="section-marker" href="#Deploying-using-static-Cassandra-contact-points">§</a>Deploying using static Cassandra contact-points</h3>
<p>Static lookup is the default behavior in <code>akka-persistence-cassandra</code> but Lagom overrides that behavior implementing a Session provider based on service location. That allows all services to continue to operate without the need to redeploy if/when the Cassandra <code>contact-points</code> are updated or fail. Using a Service Location based approach provides higher resiliency. It is possible to hardcode the list of <code>contact-points</code> where Cassandra may be located even when the server is stared with a dynamic service locator.</p>
<p>You can decide to hardcode the Cassandra contact points when using a static service locator as described above using:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>lagom.services {
  cas_native = &quot;tcp://10.1.2.3:9042&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>But that is only possible if all your service uses a static service locator.</p>
<p>If you want to use dynamic service location for your services but need to statically locate Cassandra you may use the following setup in the <code>application.conf</code> of your service:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>cassandra.default {
  ## list the contact points  here
  contact-points = [&quot;10.0.1.71&quot;, &quot;23.51.143.11&quot;]
  ## override Lagom’s ServiceLocator-based ConfigSessionProvider
  session-provider = akka.persistence.cassandra.ConfigSessionProvider
}

cassandra-journal {
  contact-points = ${cassandra.default.contact-points}
  session-provider = ${cassandra.default.session-provider}
}

cassandra-snapshot-store {
  contact-points = ${cassandra.default.contact-points}
  session-provider = ${cassandra.default.session-provider}
}

lagom.persistence.read-side.cassandra {
  contact-points = ${cassandra.default.contact-points}
  session-provider = ${cassandra.default.session-provider}
}
</code></pre>
<p>This setup disables Lagom&rsquo;s <code>ConfigSessionProvider</code> and falls back to that provided in <code>akka-persistence-cassandra</code> which uses the list of endpoints listed in <code>contact-points</code>.</p>
<p>This configuration is part of <code>application.conf</code> and therefore it will be applied in all environments (development and production) unless overridden. See developer mode settings on <a href="CassandraServer.html#Connecting-to-a-locally-running-Cassandra-instance">overriding Cassandra setup in Dev Mode</a> for more information on settings up Cassandra in dev mode.</p>
