<p>Lagom&rsquo;s sbt and Maven based development environments allow running any number of services together with a single command.</p>
<p>The same command also reloads your services when the code changes, so that you don&rsquo;t have to manually restart them. You can stay focused on your work and let Lagom do the compiling and reloading.</p><h2 id="Running-all-services-in-Maven"><a class="section-marker" href="#Running-all-services-in-Maven">§</a>Running all services in Maven</h2>
<p>To run all services in Maven, simply run the <code>lagom:runAll</code> command:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">$ cd &lt;path to your Lagom project&gt;
$ mvn lagom:runAll
INFO ...
INFO Service hello-impl listening for HTTP on 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:23966
INFO Service hello-stream-impl listening for HTTP on 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:27462
(Services started, press enter to stop and go back to the console...)
</code></pre>
<p>This may take a while if you have a lot of services or if dependencies are being retrieved for the first time.</p><h2 id="Starting-the-sbt-development-console"><a class="section-marker" href="#Starting-the-sbt-development-console">§</a>Starting the sbt development console</h2>
<p>Assuming you have have an sbt project, it&rsquo;s now time to fire up the console on your Lagom project directory:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">$ cd &lt;path to your Lagom project&gt;
$ sbt
[info] ...
&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To run all Lagom services together, with automatic reloading, just enter <code>runAll</code> in the sbt console:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">&gt; runAll
[info] ...
[info] Service hello-impl listening for HTTP on 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:23966
[info] Service stream-impl listening for HTTP on 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:27462
(Services started, press enter to stop and go back to the console...)
</code></pre>
<p>This may take a while if you have a lot of services or if dependencies are being retrieved for the first time.</p><h2 id="Hot-reloading"><a class="section-marker" href="#Hot-reloading">§</a>Hot reloading</h2>
<p>Once the &ldquo;Services started&rdquo; message has appeared, if you make a change to your source code, you&rsquo;ll see output like this in the console:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">[info] Compiling 1 Java source to /&lt;project-path&gt;/target/scala-2.11/classes...

--- (RELOAD) ---

<!-- copied this section to concepts, perhaps it can be removed later -->
<p>What&rsquo;s happening behind the scenes when you <code>runAll</code>?</p>
<ul>
  <li>an embedded Service Locator is started</li>
  <li>a Cassandra server is started</li>
  <li>a Kafka server is started</li>
  <li>your services start
    <ul>
      <li>&hellip;and register with the Service Locator</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This all happens automatically without special code or additional configuration.</p>
<!--end copied section -->
<p>You can verify that your services are running by viewing <code>http://localhost:8000/services</code> in a web browser (or with a command line tool such as <code>curl</code>). The Service Locator, running on port 8000, will return JSON such as:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;hello-stream&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://0.0.0.0:26230&quot;},
 {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;cas_native&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;tcp://127.0.0.1:4000/cas_native&quot;},
 {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;hello&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://0.0.0.0:24266&quot;}]
</code></pre>
<p><code>cas_native</code> is the <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a> server. As you will learn in the <a href="PersistentEntity.html">documentation for writing persistent and clustered services</a>, Cassandra is the default database in Lagom, and it&rsquo;s an integral part of the development environment.</p>
<p>The Service Locator, Cassandra, and Kafka are covered in more detail in the sections that follow.</p>
