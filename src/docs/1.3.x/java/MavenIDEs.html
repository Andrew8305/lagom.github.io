<p>If you worked through the command line example for <a href="GettingStartedMaven.html">Maven</a>, you have a Maven project that you can integrate into any Java IDE. </p>
<p>To integrate Maven project with Eclipse or IntelliJ, import your project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/documentation/m2e-documentation.html">m2eclipse</a> plugin in Eclipse.</li>
  <li>Using the built in <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.3/getting-started-with-maven.html">IntelliJ Maven</a> support.</li>
</ul>
<p>When developing with Lagom you will often run several services in a single Java Virtual Machine. See how to <a href="JVMMemoryOnDev.html">increase Memory for Maven</a>.</p>
