<p>The ConductR sandbox is a docker image to easily create a ConductR cluster locally. To run ConductR on your development machine follow the instructions on the <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/product/conductr/developer">ConductR developer page</a> up to the section <strong>Configure Docker VM</strong>. We will run the sandbox later on in this guide. Note that in order to access this page you need to login with your Lightbend account. If you don&rsquo;t have an account yet, head out to the <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/account/register">Sign Up page</a> and create a free account.</p>
<p>Verify the successful installation of the <code>conductr-cli</code> by running the <code>conduct</code> command within the terminal:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">$ conduct
usage: conduct [-h]
               {version,info,services,acls,load,run,stop,unload,events,logs}
               ...
</code></pre>
<p>You can also verify the successful installation of the ConductR sandbox by running <code>sandbox</code> within the terminal:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">$ sandbox
usage: sandbox [-h] {run,debug,stop,init} ...
</code></pre><h2 id="Using-ConductR-with-your-build"><a class="section-marker" href="#Using-ConductR-with-your-build">§</a><a href="#using-conductr-with-your-build" name="using-conductr-with-your-build">Using ConductR with your build</a></h2>
<p>To use ConductR with sbt, add the <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/sbt-conductr">sbt-conductr plugin</a> to your <code>project/plugins.sbt</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-sbt">addSbtPlugin(&quot;com.lightbend.conductr&quot; % &quot;sbt-conductr&quot; % &quot;2.1.17&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>sbt-conductr adds several commands to the sbt console:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>install</code> to introspect your projects and then load and run them within the sandbox</li>
  <li><code>generateInstallationScript</code> to produce an installation script to deploy your Lagom system that you can then tailor</li>
  <li><code>bundle:dist</code> to produce individual ConductR packages for your services</li>
  <li><code>configuration:dist</code> to produce individual custom ConductR configuration for your services</li>
  <li>Commands from the <code>conductr-cli</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It also adds the ConductR libraries to your classpath, which provide components, including the service locator and other components necessary for initialization on ConductR, which you can mix in with your application cake. To do so, mix <code>ConductRApplicationComponents</code> into your production cake:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-scala">import com.lightbend.lagom.scaladsl.server._
import com.typesafe.conductr.bundlelib.lagom.scaladsl.ConductRApplicationComponents

class HelloApplicationLoader extends LagomApplicationLoader {

  override def load(context: LagomApplicationContext) =
    new HelloApplication(context) with ConductRApplicationComponents

  override def loadDevMode(context: LagomApplicationContext) =
    new HelloApplication(context) with LagomDevModeComponents

}</code></pre>
<p>Once you have added this to each of your services, you should be ready to run in ConductR.</p><h2 id="Run-it-all"><a class="section-marker" href="#Run-it-all">§</a><a href="#run-it-all" name="run-it-all">Run it all</a></h2>
<p>The simplest thing that you can do in order to deploy your entire Lagom system is to run a local ConductR cluster and then run the <code>install</code> command.</p>
<p>To start a ConductR cluster locally you should use the ConductR sandbox which is a docker image based on Ubuntu that includes ConductR. With this docker image you can easily spin up multiple ConductR nodes on your local machine. The <code>sandbox run</code> command will pick up and run this ConductR docker image. In order to use this command we need to specify the ConductR version. Note that this version is the version of ConductR itself and not the version of the <code>sbt-conductr</code> plugin. Please visit again the <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/product/conductr/developer">ConductR Developer page</a> to pick up the latest ConductR version from the section <strong>Quick Configuration</strong>.</p>
<p>First, start the sbt console from the terminal:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">$ sbt
</code></pre>
<p>Now start the local ConductR cluster with the <code>sandbox run</code> command:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">&gt; sandbox run &lt;CONDUCTR_VERSION&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You can then install your entire Lagom system in one go:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">&gt; install
</code></pre>
<p>The install command will introspect your project and its sub-projects and then package, load and run everything in ConductR at once - including Cassandra. The local sandbox is expected to be running and it will first be restarted to ensure that it is in a clean state.</p>
<p>We expect that you will use the <code>install</code> command early on, but graduate to ConductR&rsquo;s lower-level commands as you evolve your services through their development lifecycle.</p>
<p>The remainder of this document describes the lower level ConductR commands.</p><h2 id="Packaging-your-services"><a class="section-marker" href="#Packaging-your-services">§</a><a href="#packaging-your-services" name="packaging-your-services">Packaging your services</a></h2>
<p>Packaging your Lagom services so that you can deliver them to ConductR is straightforward. To do this then use the <code>bundle:dist</code> command from within the sbt console:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">&gt; bundle:dist
...
[info] Bundle has been created: /my-service/myservice-impl/target/bundle/myservice-impl-v1-06f3e5872f48d69ee339b0a4b7ae382871b69de1cfc1ab831b0a18064d096733.zip

</code></pre>
<p>The above creates what is known as a &ldquo;bundle&rdquo;. A bundle is the unit of deployment with ConductR, and its filename is fingerprinted with a hash value representing the contents of the entire zip file. ConductR does this so that you can be assured that this particular bundle will always be what you knew it to be when it was generated. If its contents change then its filename will also change. ConductR also verifies that the hash provided matches the actual contents at the point that you load it. When managing your Lagom services you can therefore roll releases forward and backward with surety.</p><h2 id="Loading-and-running-your-services-during-development"><a class="section-marker" href="#Loading-and-running-your-services-during-development">§</a><a href="#loading-and-running-your-services-during-development" name="loading-and-running-your-services-during-development">Loading and running your services during development</a></h2>
<p>With the ConductR sandbox running you can load the bundle that you previously generated:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">&gt; project my-service-impl
&gt; conduct load &lt;press the tab key here&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>When starting the sbt console you are in the context of the root project. However, the bundles are created for your sub projects, i.e. your service implementations. Therefore, it is necessary to first switch with <code>project my-service-impl</code> to the sub project. Replace <code>my-service-impl</code> with the name of your sub project.</p>
<p>Finally, to run the bundle on ConductR use:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">&gt; conduct run my-service-impl
Bundle run request sent.

</code></pre>
<p>Now, the Lagom service should run in your local ConductR cluster. The IP address of your cluster is the Docker host IP address. To pick up the IP address check out the previous console output of the <code>conduct run</code> command. The default port of a Lagom service on ConductR is <code>9000</code>, e.g. considering the ConductR IP address is <code>192.168.99.100</code> then the running service is available at <code>http://192.168.99.100:9000/my/service/path</code>.</p>
<p>You can also check the state of your cluster with:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">&gt; conduct info
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>conduct</code> command allows you to manage the full lifecycle of a bundle. You can also use <code>conduct stop my-service-impl</code> and <code>conduct unload my-service-impl</code> to stop and unload your Lagom services. In addition you can use <code>conduct logs my-service-impl</code> to view the consolidated logging of bundles throughout the cluster. This is particularly useful during development.</p>
<p>To stop the ConductR sandbox use:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">&gt; sandbox stop
</code></pre><h2 id="Loading-and-running-your-services-outside-of-development"><a class="section-marker" href="#Loading-and-running-your-services-outside-of-development">§</a><a href="#loading-and-running-your-services-outside-of-development" name="loading-and-running-your-services-outside-of-development">Loading and running your services outside of development</a></h2>
<p>The sandbox is useful to validate that the packaging of your service is correct. However, at some point you want to load and run your bundle on a real ConductR cluster. While it is beyond the scope of this document to describe how to set up such a cluster (please refer to the <a href="https://conductr.lightbend.com/docs/1.1.x/Install">ConductR installation guide</a> for that), you generally interact with a real cluster through <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/conductr-cli#command-line-interface-cli-for-typesafe-conductr">the ConductR CLI</a>. You have already downloaded the CLI as part of the sandbox. The CLI commands are identical to their sbt console counterparts. Type <code>conduct --help</code> for more information on what commands are available.</p><h2 id="Running-Cassandra"><a class="section-marker" href="#Running-Cassandra">§</a><a href="#running-cassandra" name="running-cassandra">Running Cassandra</a></h2>
<p>If your Lagom service uses Cassandra for persistence then you can generate what is known as a &ldquo;bundle configuration&rdquo; for Cassandra. First switch to your root project and then generate the bundle configuration:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">&gt; project /
&gt; cassandra-configuration:dist
...
[info] Bundle has been created: /my-project/target/configuration-bundle/cassandra-configuration-06f3e5872f48d69ee339b0a4b7ae382871b69de1cfc1ab831b0a18064d096733.zip
[success] Total time: 4 s, completed 05/03/2016 2:43:07 PM
</code></pre>
<p>You can then load the Cassandra bundle with your Cassandra bundle configuration on to ConductR. Note that in this case <code>cassandra</code> represents the bundle and the <code>cassandra-configuration-&lt;hash&gt;.zip</code> file is the bundle configuration. The previous command prints out the bundle configuration zip file on the console. Copy this file to load Cassandra with your project specific configuration:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-console">&gt; conduct load cassandra /my-project/target/configuration-bundle/cassandra-configuration-06f3e5872f48d69ee339b0a4b7ae382871b69de1cfc1ab831b0a18064d096733.zip
</code></pre>
<p>The tab completion of <code>conduct load</code> only works for bundles of the project. The Cassandra bundle is an external bundle hosted on bintray. Therefore tab completion doesn&rsquo;t work in this case.</p>
<p>To run the cassandra bundle execute:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>&gt; conduct run cassandra
</code></pre>
<p>If the Cassandra bundle has been started on ConductR after the Lagom service itself then it will take a couple of seconds until the Lagom service connects to Cassandra.</p>
<p>For convenience we recommend that you start with one Cassandra cluster per root sbt project, which of course can contain many Lagom projects (and therefore services). Bounded contexts are always maintained via separate key-spaces, and so having one Cassandra cluster is viable for supporting many microservices. The actual number of Cassandra clusters required will be the <em>Lagom amount</em> i.e. &ldquo;just the right amount&rdquo; for your system.
