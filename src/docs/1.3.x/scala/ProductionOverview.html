<p>Lagom doesn&rsquo;t prescribe any particular production environment, however out of the box support is provided for <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/products/conductr">Lightbend ConductR</a>.</p><h2 id="Deploying-Lagom-services-to-ConductR"><a class="section-marker" href="#Deploying-Lagom-services-to-ConductR">ยง</a><a href="#deploying-lagom-services-to-conductr" name="deploying-lagom-services-to-conductr">Deploying Lagom services to ConductR</a></h2>
<p>Lightbend ConductR is a perfect match for Lagom, as it provides the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a means to manage configuration distinctly from your packaged artifact;</li>
  <li>consolidated logging across many nodes;</li>
  <li>a supervisory system whereby if your service(s) terminate unexpectedly then they are automatically restarted;</li>
  <li>the ability to scale up and down with ease and with speed;</li>
  <li>handling of network failures, in particular those that can lead to a split brain scenario;</li>
  <li>automated seed node discovery when requiring more than one instance of your service so that they may share a cluster;</li>
  <li>the ability to perform rolling updates of your services;</li>
  <li>support for your services being monitored across a cluster; and</li>
  <li>the ability to test your services locally prior to them being deployed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To deploy your Lagom services using ConductR, see <a href="ConductR.html">ConductR</a>.</p><h2 id="Deploying-to-other-platforms"><a class="section-marker" href="#Deploying-to-other-platforms">ยง</a><a href="#deploying-to-other-platforms" name="deploying-to-other-platforms">Deploying to other platforms</a></h2>
<p>Lagom sbt support leverages the <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/">sbt-native-packager</a> to produce archives of various types. By default zip archives can be produced, but you can also produce tar.gz, MSI, debian, RPM, Docker and more.</p>
<p>If using Maven, there are many plugins for Maven to produce artifacts for various platforms.</p>
<p>Running a package requires the provision of a service locator implementation i.e. something that provides the ability for your service to be able to lookup the location of another dynamically at runtime. At a technical level, you provide an implementation of a <a href="api/com/lightbend/lagom/scaladsl/api/ServiceLocator.html">ServiceLocator</a>.</p><h3 id="Deploying-using-static-service-locations"><a class="section-marker" href="#Deploying-using-static-service-locations">ยง</a><a href="#deploying-using-static-service-locations" name="deploying-using-static-service-locations">Deploying using static service locations</a></h3>
<p>While we would never advise using static service locations in any production situation, as a means to demonstrating a working Lagom system in the absence of a managed runtime, you may decide to deploy Lagom systems to static locations with a static configuration saying where the systems live.</p>
<p>To aid in achieving this, a <a href="api/com/lightbend/lagom/scaladsl/client/ConfigurationServiceLocator.html"><code>ConfigurationServiceLocator</code></a> is provided that reads the service locator configuration out of Lagom&rsquo;s <code>application.conf</code> file. Here is an example of the configuration for it:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>lagom.services {
  serviceA = &quot;http://10.1.2.3:8080&quot;
  serviceB = &quot;http://10.1.2.4:8080&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To instruct Lagom to use the <code>ConfigurationServiceLocator</code>, you can mix in the <a href="api/com/lightbend/lagom/scaladsl/client/ConfigurationServiceLocatorComponents.html"><code>ConfigurationServiceLocatorComponents</code></a> trait into your application:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-scala">import com.lightbend.lagom.scaladsl.devmode.LagomDevModeComponents
import com.lightbend.lagom.scaladsl.server._
import com.lightbend.lagom.scaladsl.client.ConfigurationServiceLocatorComponents

class HelloApplicationLoader extends LagomApplicationLoader {

  override def load(context: LagomApplicationContext) =
    new HelloApplication(context) with ConfigurationServiceLocatorComponents

  override def loadDevMode(context: LagomApplicationContext) =
    new HelloApplication(context) with LagomDevModeComponents

}</code></pre>
<p>This shows the configuration service locator being used only in prod mode, while the dev mode service locator is used in dev mode by mixing in the <code>LagomDevModeComponents</code> trait.</p>
